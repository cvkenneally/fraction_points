# fraction_points

This C++ program takes 4 points ( ex. (1/1,2/1) ) to create 2 segments and lets the user know:
     
    - if the segments are collinear, parallel, if they intersect, if they arent parallel but dont intersect
    - if they intersect, the program calculates where they intersect and prints it to the user

NOTE: Adjust the makefile to find the directories where you save the files
